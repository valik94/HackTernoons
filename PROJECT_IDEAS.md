Added Ideas
1.	Mind/phone controlling 3D printing (raspberry pi) to start/pause/stop/cancel print 
2.	Mind controlling directory files to be uploaded into slicing software (converting STL file to G Code) then uploading onto printer and starting print. Choose which file you want to 3D print, then convert the file (STL) into G-Code by uploading through slicing software and upload into raspberry pi computer of the 3D printer and Launch the print.
3.	Remote controlled 3D printer using phone app
4.	Mind controlling CAD design (preferably using off shelf tech i.e. VR sets to see in 3D, sensor wand to sketch/design lines, shapes, etc).
5.	Autonomous 3D printer controlled using phone/headset.
